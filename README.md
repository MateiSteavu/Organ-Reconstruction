# Organ-Reconstruction
This is a project I am still working on. 

I am trying to reach an impressive resolution, combine it with image
segmentation, vascular generation with Brownian motion and spline
functions to achieve better resolution.

The purpose of this project is to create an open source organ segmentation 
and generation tool specifically designed with 3D bioprinting in mind.
